# *This file is for the STAT545 UBC **statistics** course.* 
_This Participation Repo_ allows me to submit my participation assignments for marks.

## The repo has a folder for each homework assignment, and also the RMD and html, after we started using it. \*I'm sure you will be able to find everything you need\*

*Finally*, CM0011 was a series of files, and they each have a little bit, but the main file is "class oct 8.R"
 
 Thanks!
