```

summarize, take a vector and crunch it down to a single number. Mu, sigma. Mean life expectancy.
Datafram, compress down to a single row. 
summarize gapminder,  mu, sigma. new column mu, right hand is calcularition. how does it know what 
within the summarize function theres a new environment, gapminder data frame. how does int know lifeExp, if it does not know object.
vector labelled life exp.
mutate adds the column to the tibble
summarize got rid of all the columns except what we are looking at. by necessity there must be one value. gets rid of all of the rows. 
group_by function, 
group by, all rows by asia in 56 is one group, all rows in group have a year 1957
cant group a data frame 
group_by doesnt resort your label.
what is difference between group by and arrange
kind of like mutate small lifeexp=lifeExp<60
added an arrange just to be safe. earlier years first, later years last.

drop na in tidry, takes a tibble and drops na.

still dont
these all take in a tibble and return a tibble
what is purpose of group by, dont understand benefit of breaking it into chunks, why not arrange

WE ARE ON MDY FUNCTION, LUBRIDATE YMD, sorts dates.

lubridate, we can extract information.
day function, 24
but lubridate package fell short. doesnt let you make a year month object. tsibble package does allow you. extract year month, particular date, year mont h.
can get rid of na, so if you do the lag then there is not going to give you the wrong answer. 
if you want to group by a time inder instead of group by you use index by.

Both are useful for 1 variable
Jitter plot, would ou have to group ahead of time? No, you donâ€™t , it already splits different continents into different bins on the x ais.

Can you add an if statement to ggplot, if you only want to see the plot corresponding to 
Boplot, median is there. 
Where 50% of the variation lives with it. Box and whisker plot as well
whenever you have the opportunity to show raw data, then you should. you dont know how many observations there are.

priduces a density plot and stcks them in front of each  other- geom gg ridges. very powerful pot. this is when not quantitative, relative spread and where bulk of density is lying. you ahve to load the ggridges. geom_rod, theres like a little bar wherever there is an observation.
violin plot as well, and its like ridgeplot on its side, 90 degrees turned, and hills symmetrival.

geom_bar, geom_col
important to know the differenc.
heights of bar, heights of col.
geom bar calculates what goes on y axis for us. 

geom line, tak a scatterplot of your data, and connect the dots from left to right. here it is grouping for every single year, applies geom _likne to every group, which is year. parsing of times adn dates. 

what is lubridate
geom path connects the dots in the order they appear in the dataframe
